# Natty-Studios-Demo-Page

This design is something I've had in mind for a while - a portfolio for my music and production services. It is public, and hosted through GitHub as a demo for the full site once I build it out. I intent to use this as a full portfolio once finished.

There are three main JavaScript intweractions I have implemented into this site. First is an image slider showcasing three examples of my work - studio recording, live performance, and mixing/mastering. Buttons are present on either side of the slideshow to control which image is present, though the images will rotate every 5 seconds if not touched.. The second interaction is a mailto link from an onclick() event in the "Contact" section of the navigation bar, allowing a user to directly email me to request a service. Lastly, I have implemented a light/dark theme, and a button in the bottom left of the screen toggles it. 


The main challenge I faced was figuring out how to overlay my logo above the sliding images. It took way too long to figure out how to properly overlay it by making its position absolute, and then figuring out how to properly position it on the screen.
